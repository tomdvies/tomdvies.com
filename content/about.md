I'm Tom, a 20 y/o Masters student at the University of Edinburgh, studying Statistics & Data Science. 
For my undergrad, I studied Maths at the University of Cambridge primarily taking courses in Statistics, Probability, and Analysis. 
I'm primarily interested in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science.
I mostly work in python, rust, and/or C++ and all the source code for projects will be provided on my [github](https://github.com/tomdvies).
