You are [here]( {{< ref "_index" >}} ), stay a while, or don't. 

I'm Tom, a 21 y/o PhD student in the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, focusing on understanding embeddings in AI models.

For my undergrad, I studied Maths at the University of Cambridge primarily taking courses in Statistics, Probability, and Analysis. I've previously interned at DAMTP (Cambridge Applied Mathematics Department) and the Maxwell Institute, both in machine learning for imaging.
I'm interested in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science.

Check out [etamac](/etamac), a small project I made for getting better at numeracy (essentially a zetamac clone).
