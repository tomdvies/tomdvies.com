You are [here]( {{< ref "_index" >}} ), stay a while, or don't. 

I'm Tom, a 21 y/o Masters student at the University of Edinburgh, studying Statistics & Data Science. 
I'm also an incoming PhD student in the School of Mathematics at Edinburgh, focusing on embeddings for machine learning.

For my undergrad, I studied Maths at the University of Cambridge primarily taking courses in Statistics, Probability, and Analysis. 
I'm interested in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science.

Check out [etamac](/etamac), a small project I made for getting better at numeracy (essentially a zetamac clone).
