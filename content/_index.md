You are [here]( {{< ref "_index" >}} ), stay a while, or don't. 

I'm Tom, a 20 y/o Masters student at the University of Edinburgh, studying Statistics & Data Science. 
For my undergrad, I studied Maths at the University of Cambridge primarily taking courses in Statistics, Probability, and Analysis. 
I'm interested in the intersection of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science.
