<b>Who am I?</b>
I'm an MSc student at the University of Edinburgh studying Stats + Data Science. I finished my undergad in Maths at Cambridge in 2024.


<b>What is this?</b>
A loose collection of work that I am either proud of, or feel deserves a more indepth explanation than it's sourcecode being dumped on my <a href="https://github.com/tomdvies">github</a>.
All work displayed here may (probably will) be outdated, or depreceated. 
For an example of this see the documentation of my reverse engineering of "raven", Cambridge's legacy internal auth platform which is now defunct. 


<b>Aims for future:</b>
Web portal for fetching lectures, fetch file links client side as they require no authorisation then fetch actual files serverside and upload.
Auto fetching of lectures if they start being deleted, shouldn't be too bad just fetch everyday at 1am might be an issue if fetching more than 5 a day.


<b>Relevant links:</b>

<a href="./panoptobinds.html">Notes and details on relevant paths for panopto lecture downloading.</a>
